DESCRIPTION
This is the code used in sensor positioning for data-driven flow visualization combining PIV and probes (using time-embedded probes in the downstream). Here is an example on 2D simulation of the pinball case (the wake of 3 circles).

PLATFORM
The codes are tested on:
AMD ThreadRipper 3990X/256 GB DDR4
Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS/5.15.0-131-generic/MATLAB R2022a
around 1 hour for 2D case

DATABASE

RUNNING
1. downloading data from zenodo, which is on Pinball_DNS
2. downloading the codes here and move to Pinball_DNS/
3. converting .h5 file to .mat file using h52mat.m
4. run traversing.m on MATLAB
